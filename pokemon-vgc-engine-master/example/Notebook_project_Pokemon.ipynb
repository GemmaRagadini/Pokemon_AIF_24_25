Our team selected the task involving the simulation of a Pokémon battle between two teams, each composed of three Pokémon. The battle consists of three matches, with the first player to knock out all three Pokémon of the opposing player declared the winner of the match. The battle is considered concluded when a player wins at least two out of three matches.\n",

Both players operate under the same conditions, with their teams assigned randomly, ensuring that any advantages or disadvantages are also determined by chance\n",

Specifically, we focused on the section related to game theory (Chapter 6 of the textbook) and examined various approaches to the Minimax algorithm and its variations. This included the implementation of alpha-beta pruning and heuristics such as the killer move heuristic and transposition tables. Additionally, we explored implementations of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms and investigated combinations of the two approaches (Minimax and MCTS)."
